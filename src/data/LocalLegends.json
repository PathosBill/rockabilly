    "name": "Billy Lee Riley",
    "description": "In 1933, Billy Lee Riley was born the son of a sharecropper in Pocahontas, where he learned to play the guitar from black farmworkers. He signed with Sun Records in 1956 and released Trouble Bound, with Rock with Me Baby on the B side. Riley followed up with Red Hot in 1957, and while the record had the potential to be a hit, it never found commercial success because Sun chose to focus on promoting Jerry Lee Lewis instead. Riley went on to release several more records, but they also failed to find a widespread audience. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he played with the likes of Dean Martin and The Beach Boys. In a twist of fate, Riley experienced newfound popularity in the late 1970s with the Rockabilly Revival in Europe and released new records in the 1990s and 2000s. Riley passed away on August 2, 2009 in Jonesboro.",

After returning home in 1954, Deckelman found popularity with Memphis audiences but couldn’t secure a record deal. After a brief stint in California, Deckelman returned home, formed The Bop Kings, and founded his own record label, Van-Deck. Through Van-Deck, he released the rockabilly songs I’ve Got Love and Born to Lose in 1959. While the songs were local hits, Deckelman never found national fame. As rockabilly’s appeal waned in the 1960s, he continued to release songs but faded into obscurity.",

    "description": "Born on a strawberry farm in Quitman on June 7, 1937, Teddy Redell grew up playing the piano. He took formal lessons for eight years, when his teacher taught him classical pieces as well as boogie woogie and ragtime songs. After making his radio debut at age 15 on KCWB in Searcy, Redell caught the attention of Wayne Raney, who invited Redell to tour with him. Redell went on to work as a session musician for the Dub, Stylo, and Vaden record labels, and played piano on the rockabilly tracks Little More Lovin’ by Chuck Comer and Black Cadillac by Joyce Green. Redell also released his own singles, including the rockabilly song It’ll Be Me.",

    "description": "Wayne Raney was born August 17, 1921 on a farm in Wolf Bayou. He started playing the harmonica at an early age, wearing his harmonica around his neck as he worked in the  fields and playing it when he could take a break. He was best known as a country musician but between 1946 and 1952 recorded some pre-rockabilly boogie songs with the Delmore Brothers, such as Del Rio Boogie (1949). Late in the 1950s, Raney worked as a disc jockey, record producer, and label owner (starting Rimrock Records, a bluegrass-oriented label), as well as experimenting with rock and roll, as with his Decca Records version of Shake Baby Shake (1957). Raney died on January 23, 1993.",
